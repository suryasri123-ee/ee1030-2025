You find that all the plants grown in the greenhouse have stems that stand upright. Which one or more of the following explanations best support(s) your observations?\hfill{(GATE EY 2024)}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The different morphologies in the natural habitat types are due to phenotypic plasticity.

        \item Numerous resources are consistently available throughout the year, allowing different species to specialize on different resources, thereby minimizing competition and allowing co-existence.

        \item Low seasonality is associated with more stable populations that are less vulnerable to demographic stochasticity and extinction.
        \item Low seasonality is associated with longer generation times, which enhances species richness.
