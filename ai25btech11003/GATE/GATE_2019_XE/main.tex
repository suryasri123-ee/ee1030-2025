Pack surface area is 0.0012 m$^{2}$ per gram of dry food solids, EMC of the food is 6\% (d.b.), initial moisture content is 2\% (d.b.), critical moisture content is 5\% (d.b.) and slope of moisture sorption isotherm is 3.4\% (d.b.) per unit water activity ($a_w$). Sealed pack is stored at $30^\circ$C. Assume that the vapor pressure of pure water at $30^\circ$C is 31.7 torr. Time required for the food to reach the critical moisture content (days) is \underline{\hspace{2cm}} (round off to 1 decimal place).

\item Freezing of 100 mm spherical meat ball with 60\% moisture at $35^\circ$C is being done in an air blast freezer maintained at $-45^\circ$C. Given, latent heat of fusion for water is 333.2 kJ$\cdot$kg$^{-1}$, thermal conductivity of meat is 1.5 W$\cdot$m$^{-1}\cdot{}^\circ$C$^{-1}$, convective heat transfer coefficient is 40 W$\cdot$m$^{-2}\cdot{}^\circ$C$^{-1}$, density of frozen meat is 980 kg$\cdot$m$^{-3}$ and initial freezing temperature of meat ball is $-10^\circ$C. Using Plank's equation, freezing time (h) is \underline{\hspace{2cm}} (round off to 2 decimal places).
