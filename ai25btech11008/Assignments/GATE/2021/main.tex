The diluted plasmid solution gives an absorbance of $0.550$ at $260$ nm. The concentration of the purified plasmid in $\mu g\,\mu L^{-1}$ (rounded off to two decimal places) is

\item A bacterium produces acetic acid from ethanol as per the following reaction
\[
2CH_3CH_2OH + 2O_2 \rightarrow 2CH_3COOH + 2H_2O
\]
The thermodynamic maximum yield of acetic acid from ethanol in $g\,g^{-1}$ (rounded off to two decimal places) is
